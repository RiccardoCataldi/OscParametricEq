# OscParametricEq
Parametric Eq Controller By Osc 

The goal of this project was to develop an interactive parametric equalizer for audio manipulation.

The equalizer was designed to allow users to adjust frequency bands, Q factor, gain, and bypass control in real-time to achieve the desired audio effects.

The program implements a parametric equalizer in Python using the Pyo library.

The equalizer consists of five bands, each with adjustable control parameters through a user graphical interface (GUI).

The program utilizes the OSC protocol to receive control messages from the GUI and dynamically adjust the equalizer settings.
